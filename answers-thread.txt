Thread 1:
put(1, 1);
put(2, 2);

Thread 2:
put(3, 3);

Thread 1 first inserted (1, 1) to the map, and then inserts (2, 2).
Simultaneously, thread 2 inserts (3, 3). If thread 1 executes line 36
<code> *p = e </code> earlier than thread 2, pair (2, 2) will be override
and lost. When someone wants to get the value of key 2, the map will
return 0.
