(1) Registers for function arguments: a0, a1, ..., a7.
    Register a2 stores 13 for printf.

(2) Function main inlines function f (instructions 0x1c ~ 0x22), and similarly f inlines g (simply copys g, 0xe ~ 0x1a).

(3) Function printf locates at 0x630

(4) Register ra holds 0x38 (the address of next instruction) after jalr.

(5) Output: He110 World
    If RISC-V is big-endian, variable i should be set to 0x726c6400, and the value 57616 should holds.

(6) The value in register a2 (an unexpected value, maybe the third argument of the caller of printf) will be outputed.
    That's because function printf tries to read the third argument which should be stored in a2 (but the caller doesn't provide it).
