The third statement is to prevent overflow.

For example, srcva = 1, len = 18446744073709551615 (2^64-1), p->sz = 5,
these values will case:
    srcva < p->sz, 1st statement NOT satisfied;
    srcva+len = 0 < p->sz, 2st statement NOT satisfied;
    srcva+len = 0 < srcva, 3st statement satisfied,
the third statement leads to the function returning -1.
